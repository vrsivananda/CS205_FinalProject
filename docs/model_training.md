### Background on LSTM Models

As discussed in the problem background, Long-Short-Term Memory models are a variant of recurrent neural networks. These style of networks take a univariate or multivariate sequence of data points, and pass each of these points through a series of "cells", which propagate information from the beginning of the sequence through to the end. Figure 1 below highlights a generalized recurrent neural network:
